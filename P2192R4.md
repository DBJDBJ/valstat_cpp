There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. -- [C.A.R. Hoare](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/C._A._R._Hoare)

## 1. Abstract

This is a proposal about logical, feasible, lightweight and effective handling of information returned from functions, based on the [valstat protocol](https://github.com/DBJDBJ/valstat).

Please take a slight and quick detour to read that document first.

<!-- Also this paper proposes some possible solutions, to some of deeply rooted ISO C++ issues [[3](#ref3)][[15](#ref15)].  -->

Implemented in standard C++, this would be a tiny std library citizen without any language change required.

<span id="motivation" />

## 2. From error to returned information handling

In standard C++ there is no unanimously adopted standard call/response handling idiom or return type. Like there is in [Rust](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/6-error-handling.html), [GO](https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go) , JavaScript [to some extent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error), [Swift](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ErrorHandling.html) and so on alsmot ad infinitum.

As of today, in the std lib, there are more than few, **error** handling paradigms, idioms and return types. Accumulated through decades, from ancient to contemporary. Together they have inevitably contributed to a rising technical debt present inside C++ std lib. 

<!-- 
But none of them serves the ISO C++ users, returns handling requirements. Think famous, HTTP codes handling algorithms, as an well known example. Lack of a common and ubiquitous non trivial returns handling recommendation or solutions is raising the level of complexity for all levels of application architectures developed with standard C++. -->

<!-- What is "Returns handling"? Returns aka "call/response" handling is the next step in evolution of error handling. It is the true picture of a real life code. Returns handling is already deployed in API consuming algorithms, required to deal with wider scope of issues, opposed to a simple "error or no error", returns processing logic.  -->
<!-- 
Valstat protocol is an effort to implement requirement categories, across domains. -->

In order to achieve the required wide scope of the valstat protocol, implementation has to be simple. valstat actual programming language shape has to be completely problem domain or context free. Put simply the C++ std lib implementation must not influence or dictate the usage beside supporting the protocol. 

Please see [Appendix B: Requirements Across Domains](#9-appendix-b-requirements-common-across-domains) for a bit more detailed but quick overview.

## 3. valstat

*"A paradigm is a standard, perspective, or set of ideas. A paradigm is a way of looking at something ... When you change paradigms, you're changing how you think about something..."* [vocabulary.com](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/paradigm)

When developing or calling (ISO C++) API's returning std::optional, users are already applying the two stages logic: 

- step one -- Is something returned? 
- step two -- Can I use it?   

Conceptually valstat paradigm belongs to the same category of the "two step" returns processing paradigms:

- step one: use metastates to determine the outcome
    - not using the type system
- step two: use the content returned
    - using the type system

That is in a way same as std::optional but without it, so it can be applied across many domains.

### 3.1. Field

Let us postulate the existence of a function: 
```cpp
 // returns true if field is empty
       bool is_empty( Field f ) ;
```
That function is letting us know what is the "state of occupancy" of an "field". Is it empty or not. But what is this "Field thing" ?

C++ "field" is analogous to the database field. The name "field" is the name for an "single piece of information", in database theory also known as "field". "field" in the database is what in C++ is: *"a particular piece of data encapsulated within a class or object"* [ref [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(computer_science))]. 

#### 3.1.1. Occupancy states

Field can be in two "occupancy states"  (authors term) . We will call them : "empty" and "occupied". It is a well known and adopted fact: database field always exist, but it can be empty.

std::optional is a well known implementation of a C++ field, sometimes known as "container of one". It's instance is an object **potentially** holding only one variable defined in it. It might be tested if it is empty; "not holding a value". Or, occupied or "holding a value".

### 3.2. Definition

> valstat is the foundation to the family of returns handling idioms

As meta-language is language of languages, **valstat** is "state of states". valstat is an boolean AND combination of occupancy states of two fields. Named: Value and Status. A bit more formal definition is in [Appendix C](#10-appendix-c-valstat-bnf-definition).

Combination of value *and* status occupancies is giving four possible metastates. We will label them for further use, for step one of returns processing.

| Meta State Label | Value occupancy  | op | Status occupancy  |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | --- |
| **Info**  | occupied | AND | occupied |
| **OK**    | occupied | AND | Empty     |
| **Error** | Empty     | AND | occupied |
| **Empty** | Empty     | AND | Empty     |

valstat labels are just that: labels. Just indicating the behaviour. 

That is it. That is the core, adopters can use when solving their requirements listed in the Motivation section. Put in some simple C++ code, valstat idea is really rather simple and easy to comprehend.  

> In adopting the valstat paradigm we do not immediately inspect returned values, we inspect the relationship of two fields returned first.

```cpp
// there is no special type returned
// both returns are fields 
// metastates are captured AND-ing their occupancy states
// metastates are used in step one of returns processing
auto [value, status] = metastate_enabled_function ();
```
Like in the most other languages, in C++ there is no need for existence of some dedicated valstat type.  We only care about the relationship between two fields states of occupancy.

valstat capturing is the step one of return handling logic. valstat capturing is the act of decoding the relationship between occupancy states of its two fields. Following is canonical capturing of the four possible metastates:

```cpp
// pseudo code
// two fields are input into the idiom of
// capturing all four possible metastates
// This is step one of return processing
// In step one types or values of the
// content returned are not used
// they are irrelevant in step one
// 
  if (   is_empty( value ) &&   is_empty( status )  { /* info */ }
  if (   is_empty( value ) && ! is_empty( status )  { /* ok   */ }
  if ( ! is_empty( value ) &&   is_empty( status )  { /* error*/ }
  if ( ! is_empty( value ) && ! is_empty( status )  { /* empty*/ }
```
That is not C++ but it can be. As well as it can be many other languages: C, JavaScript, Python, Java etc. In standard C++ reality we do not need is_empty() function from above. We can use std::optional as a readily available field type.
```cpp
// C++ code
// fields are std::optional instances
// this is still step one
// we do not need type or value of a content
// just two fields occupancy states
auto [value, status] = metastate_enabled_function ();

  if (   value &&   status )  { /* info */ }
  if (   value && ! status )  { /* ok   */ }
  if ( ! value &&   status )  { /* error*/ }
  if ( ! value && ! status )  { /* empty*/ }
```

As return is neatly divided in two stages, valstat logic serves well for arriving to cleaner idioms for complex returns handling. The aded benefits are immediate applicability and ability in addressing the requirements from the [Motivation section](#motivation): strict runtime requirements solving across domains. Also arriving to a more energy friendly C++ coded executables.[[6](#ref6)] 

### 3.3. What this has to do with the std lib?

This proposal's value also lies in it's deliberate simplicity, aiding in solving the strict operational requirements and interoperability.

Modern software architectures are clusters of interoperating but separated components. Thorny not-a-detail is solving universally applicable returns handling, across language and system  barriers.  And this is where valstat as a paradigm might help. (Think JSON with valstat inside) 

Universal adoption of the valstat paradigm, would be greatly aided by placing one tiny template in the standard C++ std lib. This proposal requires no changes in the core language. Truth to be told there is not a single type proposed. Just one template.

div class="page"/ -->

## 4. valstat protocol C++ definition

valstat protocol defines information as made of state and data. valstat structure is response information carrier. it is made of two fields: value and status.
```
structure valstat
   field value
   field status
```
valstat protocol field has two occupancy states
```
    field_state ::= empty | occupied
```

Valstat enabled API returns valstat structure instance made by encapsulated application logic, in order to pass the information to the caller. The valstat protocol users (callers), have the opportunity to decode (aka capture) one of the four states, carried over from a call responder. 

> That is wider functionality than simple error handling by some special value returned.

Information carried over by valstat structure is handled in two steps:

1. Step One
   - decode the state 
2. Step Two
   - use the data 

### 4.1. std::valstat

"std::valstat" is a name of the C++ template, offering the greatest possible degree of freedom for valstat protocol adopters. Implementation is simplest possible, resilient, lightweight and feasible. Almost transparent. 

*std::valstat\<T,S\>* as a template is an generic interface whose aliases and definitions allow the easy "step 1" state decoding by examining the state of occupancy of the 'value' and 'status' fields.

```cpp
// Synopsis
// std lib header: <valstat>
namespace std 
{
 template< typename V, typename S >
	struct [[nodiscard]] valstat
 {
    // both types must be able to 
    // simply and resiliently
    // exhibit state of occupancy
    // "empty" or "occupied"
		using value_field_type  = V ;
		using status_field_type = S ;

    // valstat state is deduced by combining
    // state of occupancy of these two fields
		value_field_type   value;
		status_field_type  status;
 };
} // std
```
*std::valstat* will is assuring the valstat protocol in the realm of ISO C++, only as an recommendation. It will not mandate its usage in any way. It should be in a separate header *\<valstat\>*, to allow for complete decoupling from any of the std lib types and headers. 

Let us repeat: std::valstat is a recommendation. valstat protocol can be implemented in many ways in C++; and many other languages as a matter of fact.

### 4.2. Type requirements

Both value and status field types, should offer a simple mechanism that reveals their occupancy state. Readily available type offering that "field like" behavior is [std::optional<T>](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional). 

In specific contexts a native pointer or any other type can serve the same purpose, as it will be explained shortly. What is the meaning of "empty" for a particular C++ type, and what is not, depends on the context. Please see an [example in the appendix](#82-fully-functional-valstat-type-not-using-stdoptional-and-not-using-stdvalstat)

#### Difference v.s. previous proposals

What is the difference vs the two other "current" proposals, persevered through years of selection: 

- std::status_code
  - http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1028r0.pdf
- std::expected
  - http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p0323r9.html

Differences are:

1. the above are based on special types purposely designed and developed to be returned from functions.
   1. std::valstat is not a type. it is a template implementing the valstat protocol
   2. type based on std::valstat can use any types appropriate
2. the above serve the purpose inside the standard C++ only
   1. valstat protocol is language agnostic
   2. valstat protocol has no exceptions related parts
   3. std::valstat based types solve the no-exception requirement too
4. None of the above carries same kind of information as valstat protocol does.
   1. Fields on the valstat structure can contain values of any type

<span id="my_valstat" ></span>

### 4.3. my::valstat 

Template is not a type. "my::valstat" is a descriptive name of a template alias we will use for illustration purposes in most examples in this proposal. We will solve the occupancy requirement imposed on valstat fields by simply using std::optional. We will show we do not need hundreds (thousands?) of lines of non-trivial C++ required for implementation of special "error handling" type. No need to be concerned about the implementation complexity[[13](#ref13)]. 

```cpp
// 'my' is adopters namespace 
namespace my {
// ready to operate on almost any type
// std::optional rules permitting
template<typename T, typename S>
using valstat = std::valstat< 
         std::optional<T>, 
         std::optional<S> >;
} // my
```
In standard C++ world, it is not wrong to relax a valstat structure definition, down to an "AND combination" of two std::optional's. 

Now both API responders and API callers (in the *my* namespace) have the universal readily applicable my::valstat, as an simple template alias. Most of the time my::valstat C++ users will use a structured binding. Let's see some ad-hoc C++ examples of my::valstat direct usage (no calls involved yet):

```cpp
   // OK valstat created
   // both fields are std::option<int> instances
	auto [ value, status ] = my::valstat< int, int >{ 42, {} };

// step one: compare the fields occupancy
// OK state captured
// there is a value but no status returned
	if ( value && ! status ) {
      /* step two: 
         depend on the status value and type, taken from a field instance */
		std::cout << "OK valstat captured, value is: " << *value ;
	}
```
If required, the other three valstat protocol states wil be created like so:
```cpp
   // both fields are std::option<int> instances
	auto [ value, status ] = my::valstat< int, int >{ 42, 42 }; // INFO
	auto [ value, status ] = my::valstat< int, int >{ {}, {} }; // EMPTY
	auto [ value, status ] = my::valstat< int, int >{ {}, 42 }; // ERROR
```

What states are produced and their exact logic of usage, completely depends on the adopters domain.

### 4.4. bare-bones valstat 

After all this postulating, protocol and field theory and such, it might come as a surprise, in some circumstances it is quite ok and enough to be using fundamental types for both value and status fields. We can implement the "field" paradigm by using just fundamental types.

Let us consider some very strict embedded system, platform.
```cpp
   // valstat type but not as we know it
   // note: this might be defined in some C code too
   struct valstat_int_int final {
      int value;
      int status;
   };

   // both value and status fields in here are just integers
   // consuming is same as with my::valstat
   // difference is completely transparent
	auto [ value, status ] = valstat_int_int{ 42, {} }; // OK

// step one
// OK state decoding 
// (42 && !0 ) yields true
if ( value && ! status ) { uplink( value ) ; }

// other three metastates, but only if required
// again, to callers difference v.s. my::valstat 
// is completely transparent
	auto [ value, status ] = valstat_int_int{ 42, 42 }; // INFO
	auto [ value, status ] = valstat_int_int{ {}, {} }; // EMPTY
	auto [ value, status ] = valstat_int_int{ {}, 42 }; // ERROR

```
That is still valstat protocol in action. It is only, in some situations valstat field types can be two simple integers. 

```cpp
// in some specific narrow context integer is "empty" if it is zero
bool is_empty( int val_ ) {   return ! val_ ; }
```
Above is rather important valstat ability to be transparently adopted for various projects. That solution is not using std lib and is working under extremely strict pre-conditions. The already mentioned [example in the appendix](#82-fully-functional-valstat-type-not-using-stdoptional-and-not-using-stdvalstat), shows something different but similar.

<!-- div class="page"/ -->

## 5. Usage

It is admittedly hard to immediately see the connection between my::valstat or std::valstat, and the somewhat bold promises about wide spectrum of benefits, presented in the [motivation section](#motivation). 

There are many equally simple and convincing examples of valstat usage benefits. In order to keep this core proposal short we will first observe just one, but illustrative use-case. [Appendix A](#8-appendix-a) contains few more. 

### 5.1. Callers point of view

Recap: my::valstat struct instance carries (out of the functions) information: state and payload to be utilized by callers. How and why (or why not) is the valstat state decoding algorithm shaped, that completely depends on the project, the API logic and many other requirements dictated by adopters architects and developers. 

Example bellow is used by valstat adopters operating on some database. In this illustration, adopters use the valstat to pass back (to the caller) full information (state + data), obtained after the database field fetching operation. Again, please notice there is no 'special' over-elaborated return type required. That is a good thing. valstat is a protocol, there is no complex C++ type, just clean and repeatable idioms of two step returns handling.

 ```cpp
 // declaration of a valstat emitting function
 template<typename T>
// we use my::valstat type from above
// `my::stat` is 'code' from some internal code/message mechanism.
   my::valstat<T, my::stat > 
   full_field_info
   (database::row /*row_*/ , std::string_view /* field_name */ ) 
// valstat protocol naturally allows no exception throwing   
   noexcept ;
```
Primary objective is enabling callers comprehension of a full information passed out of the function, state and data. Full returns, not just error handling. 
```cpp
// full return handling after 
// the attempted field content retrieval
auto [ value, status ] = full_field_info<int>( db_row, field_name ) ;
```
When designing a solution, adopters have decided they will utilise all four valstat states. Calling code is capturing all.
```cpp
// step one
// capturing: info 
if (   value &&   status )  { 
   // step two
   std::cout << "\nSpecial value found: " << *value ;
   // *status type is my::stat
   std::cout << "\nStatus is: " << my::status_message(*status) ;
  }

// capturing: ok 
if (   value && ! status )  { 
   std::cout << "\nOK: Retrieved value: " << *value ;
  }

// capturing: error 
if ( ! value &&   status )  { 
   // in this design status contains an error code
   std::cout << "\nRead error: " <<  my::status_message(*status) ;
  }

// capturing: empty 
if ( ! value && ! status )  { 
   // empty feild is not an error
   std::cout << "\nField is empty." ;
  }

 ```
Please do note, using the same paradigm it is almost trivial to imagine that same code above, in e.g. JavaScript, calling the module written in C++ returning valstat protocol structure that JavaScript will understand. 

Let us emphasize: Not all possible states need to be captured by the caller each and every time. It entirely depends on the API design, on the logic of the calling site, on application requirements and such.

### 5.2. Responder: the API point of view

Requirements permitting, API implementers are free to choose if they will use and return them all, one,two or three valstat states. 

```cpp
// API implementation using valstat protocol
template<typename T>
my::valstat<T, my::stat > 
full_field_info
(database::row row_, std::string_view field_name ) 
// platform requirements do not allow
// throwing exceptions
            noexcept 
{
   // sanity check
   if ( field_name.size() < 1) 
    // return ERROR state
      return { {}, my::stat::name_empty };      

   // using some hypothetical database API
   // where row is made of fields
   database::field_descriptor field = row_.fetch( field_name ) ;
 
    // error can be anything not
    // just database related
    if ( field.in_error() ) 
    // return ERROR valstat
    // status is some internal code of my::stat type
      return { {}, my::stat::db_api_error( field.error() ) };      

    // empty field is not an error
    // return an EMPTY valstat structure
    if ( field.is_empty() ) 
      return { {}, {} };      

   // db type will have to be cast into the type T
   // type T handles value semantics
   T field_value{} ; 
   // try getting the value from a database field
   // and casting it into T
   if ( false == field.data( field_value ) )
   // failed, return ERROR state 
      return { {},  my::stat::type_cast_failed( field.error() ) }; 

 // solving business requirement
 // API contract requires signalling if 'special' value is found
  if ( special_value( field_value ) )       
  // return INFO state and both fields populated
   return { field_value, my::stat::special_value }; 

// value is obtained and ready
// status field is empty
// OK state signalled back 
   return { field_value, {} }; 
}
```
Basically function returning the valstat state + data, is simply returning two fields structure. With all the advantages and disadvantages imposed by the core language rules. Any kind of home grown but functional valstat type will work in there too. As long as callers can capture the states and data in two steps by using the two fields returned.

Using thread safe abstractions, or asynchronous processing is also not stopping the adopters to return the metastates from their API's.

## 6. Conclusions

*Fundamentally, the burden of proof is on the proposers.* — B. Stroustrup, [[11]](#ref11)

<!-- Hopefully proving the evolution of error code handling into returns handling does not need much convincing. There are many real returns handling situations where the valstat paradigm can be successfully used. As an common call returns handling paradigm, valstat requires to be ubiquitously adopted to become truly an instrumental to widespread interoperability. From micro to macro levels. From inside the code to inter component calls. From inside an project to inter team situations. -->

"valstat" protocol is multilingual in nature. Thus adopters from any imperative language are free to implement it in any way they wish too. The key protocol benefit is: interoperability. 

Using the same protocol implementation it is feasible to develop standard C++ code using standard library, but in restricted environments. Author is certain readership knows quite well why is that situation considered unresolved in the domain of ISO C++. 

<!-- There is no need for yet another [tractate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tractate), in the form of proposal to try and explain the background.  -->

Authors primary aim is to propagate widespread adoption of this paradigm. As shown valstat protocol implemented in C++ is more than just solving the "error-signalling problem"[[11](#ref11)]. It is an paradigm shift, instrumental in solving the often hard and orthogonal set of platform requirements described in the [motivation section](#2-motivation).

valstat protocol and C++ definition, while imposing extremely little on adopters is leaving the non-adopters to "proceed as before".

Obstacles to paradigm adoption are far from just technical. But here is at least an immediately usable attempt to chart the way out.

## 8. Appendix A

*To me, one of the hallmarks of good programming is that the code looks so simple that you are tempted to dismiss the skill of the author. Writing good clean understandable code is hard work whatever language you are using -- Francis Glassborow*

Value of the programming paradigm is best understood by seeing the code using it. The more the merrier. Here are a few more simple examples illustrating the valstat protocol and implementations applicability.

### 8.1. valstat as a solution for known and difficult problems

An perhaps very elegant solution to the "index out of bounds" problem. Using [my::valstat](#41-myvalstat) as already defined above. 

```cpp
// inside some sequence like container
// note how we use pre existing std type
// for the status field
 my::valstat< T , std::errc >
     operator [] ( size_t idx_ ) noexcept
    {
        if ( ! ( idx_ < size_ ) )
        /* ERROR state + data */
        return { {}, my::errc::invalid_argument };
        /* OK state + data */
        return { data_[idx_] , {} };
    }
```
That usage of my::valstat alone resolves few difficult and well known design issues.
```cpp
auto [ value, status ] = my_vector[42] ;

// first step: check the states
if ( value  )  { /* second step: we are here just if state is OK     */ }
if ( status )  { /* second step: we are here just if state is ERROR  */ }
```
No exceptions, no `assert()` and no `exit()`. 

<!-- As an example of the very different logic of the std lib situation in the presence of "no exceptions" requirement we might show the current [MS STL](https://github.com/microsoft/STL) solution to the above: 

```cpp
// MS STL <vector> approx line#2590 , circa 2020 Oct
    _NODISCARD reference at(size_type _Off) {
        if (size() <= _Off) {
           // from here throw and out of range exception 
           // or raise the Structured Exception (SE)
           // depending on the value of _HAS_EXCEPTIONS macro
            _Xran();
        }
        return (*this)[_Off];
    }
```
If index exceeds the size, exception is thrown from the function `_Xran()`. But there are "Requirements Across Domain" issues, we have already described in the [motivation](#21-standard-returns-handling-is-missing) section and detailed in [Appendix B: Requirements Common Across Domains](#9-appendix-b-requirements-common-across-domains). To solve those, MS STL authors have resorted to the OS specific solution. In the presence of `_HAS_EXCEPTIONS == 0` , `_Xran()`  ultimately raises the [structured exception](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/structured-exception-handling-c-cpp?view=vs-2019). The whole MS STL is, in that scenario, in the non-standard shape.

Deploying the valstat paradigm above probably will not result in [somewhat controversial](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/issues/1289) MS STL design. -->

### 8.2. Fully functional valstat type, minus std::valstat.

Let us assume we need to write a layer of safe proxies to some C run time (CRT) functions. And yes, in the same time, we are under strict requirements already mentioned many times in this paper. Thus we might be very likely not using std lib. We shall first start by declaring an **"valstat like"** template for this specific context.

```cpp
namespace crt {
template<typename T>
struct [[nodiscard]]  errno_valstat final {
   	
using value_field_type  = T ;
using status_field_type = std::errc ;

   // value based semantics
	value_field_type   value;
	status_field_type  status;

} ;
} // crt
```
That valstat variant might be used in a myriad of API's, internally facing the CRT, or CRT like API's. All returning the metastates, carried by the definitions of that one template: `errno_valstat<T>` . Examples:

```cpp
// assume some CRT proxy functions
// 
crt::errno_valstat<const char *> safe_read_line ( FILE * ) noexcept ;

crt::errno_valstat<double> safe_sqrt( double * ) noexcept ;

crt::errno_valstat<const char *> safe_strdup( const char * ) noexcept ;
```
And here are some possible and legal `crt::errno_valstat<T>` usages from insides of those functions:
```cpp
// EMPTY valstat result -- from safe_read_line ( FILE * ) ;
crt::errno_valstat<const char *> { nullptr , std::errc{} } ;

// INFO valstat  result -- from safe_read_line (FILE *)
crt::errno_valstat<const char *> { & value_ , std::errc::is_a_directory } ;

// OK valstat  result -- from safe_sqrt( double ) API
// make sure that is not address to local instance
crt::errno_valstat<double *> { & value_ , std::errc{} } ;

// ERROR valstat  result -- from safe_strdup( const char *)
crt::errno_valstat<const char *> { nullptr , std::errc::invalid_argument } ;

```
The caller using any of the above imagined crt proxy functions, will follow the same valstat capturing idiom in the step one of returns processing.
```cpp
// step one: use metastates only
// returned by calling any of the three above
// value is a native pointer , status is std::errc 
auto [value, status] = any_of_the_three_above ();

  if (   value &&   status )  { /* info */ }
  if (   value && ! status )  { /* ok   */ }
  if ( ! value &&   status )  { /* error*/ }
  if ( ! value && ! status )  { /* empty*/ }
```
That is an example to show and explain the suitability of valstat in various non standard contexts. Let's see how would modern_fopen(), might be actually implemented.

```cpp
// 
inline crt::errno_valstat<FILE*> 
  modern_fopen(const char* name_, const char* mode_) 
noexcept
{
    // the ERROR valstat is returned on bad arguments
    if (NULL == name_)
        return { {} ,  errno_to_errc(ec_) }; 

    if (NULL == mode_)
        return { {} ,  errno_to_errc(ec_) }; 

    FILE* fp_{};
    int ec_ = fopen_s(&fp_, name_, mode_);

    // file is not opened for any of many reasons
    // the ERROR valstat
    if (NULL == fp_)
        return { {} ,  errno_to_errc(ec_) }; 
    
    // return file pointer as a value field
    // and std::errc{} as a status field
    // OK valstat
    return { fp_, {} }; 
}
```
Very simple but safe, fully valstat enabled. The usage:
```cpp
// C++17 if() syntax
if (auto [ filep , errc ] 
    = modern_fopen( "non_existent_file" , "w+" ); 
   // return processing step one
   // check if value field is 'empty'
    filep )
{
   // step two:
   fprintf( filep, "non_existent_file opened" ) ;
}  
else {
   // return processing step one
   // has determined "value" field is empty
   // check the "status" field occupancy
   if ( errc )  {
   // step two begins here
   // status is not empty, we can use the content of the status field
   auto message = errc_to_string (errc);
   }
}
```
Above decouples from decades of "special return values" ,`errno` globals and POSIX "hash defines" lurking inside any C++ code base today. True that is done before. But, in addition to that, valstat enabled proxy functions, in front of the CRT legacy, are delivering resilient, uniform and interoperable solution, blessed by std lib too. And, available immediately. -->

## 9. Appendix B: Requirements Common Across Domains

### 9.1. Run-Time 

Perhaps the key reasons for appearance of C++ dialects, are to be found in the std lib perceived inability to be used for components required to operate in the environments with limited resources available. That essentially means developing using the C++ core language but [without the std lib](https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL). [[1](#ref1)]

One motivation of this paper is to try and offer an "over arching", but simple enough, returns handling paradigm applicable across the C++ landscape. Including across a growing number of C++ dialects, fragmenting away the industry and markets relying on existence of the standard C++. 

**Minimal list** of requirements 

(for ISO C++ projects, producing components for restricted environments)

1. can not use try / throw / catch[[6](#ref6)][[15](#ref15)] 
2. can not use \<system_error\>[[14](#ref14)]
3. can not use \<iostreams\>

 For details, authoritative references are provided. Author will be so bold not to delve into the reasons and background of this list, in order to keep this paper simple and focused. Gaming, embedded systems, high performance, mission critical computing, are just the tip of the iceberg.

### 9.2. Interoperability

Each traditional solution to strict platform requirements is one nail in the coffin of interoperability. In danger of sounding like offering an panacea,  author will also draw the attention to the malleability of the valstat paradigm to be implemented with wide variety of languages used in developing components of an modern distributed system. 

Usability of an API is measured on all levels: from the code level, to the distributed system level. In order to design an API to be **feasibly** usable it has to be interoperable. That leads to three core requirements of

Interoperable API core requirements (to start with)

1. no "error code" as return value
   - Complexity arises from "special" error codes multiplied with different types multiplied with different context
   - In turn increasing the learning curve for every function in every API
   - How to decode the error code, becomes a prominent issue
     - Think Windows: `NTSTATUS`, `HRESULT`, `GetCode()`, `errno`
2. no "return arguments" aka "reference arguments" in C++.
   - language specific mutable argument solutions are definitely not interoperable.  
3. no special globals
   - Think errno legacy 
   - pure functions can not use globals

Some of the designed-in, simplicity in this paper is an result of deliberate attempt to increase the interoperability (also with other run-time environments and languages). 

It is important to understand there are inter domain interoperability requirements, not just using standard C++. Examples: [WASM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/C_to_wasm), [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html), [Android](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code) and such. 

<!--
 ### 9.3. Energy 

This is operational environment requirement. Operational environment can be satellite in an orbit, or a data center. 

Side info: it is not just hardware energy consumption, it is also energy required to [cool that data-center hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling) down.

Solving data centers energy spending has become an imperative. Most of the server side software is written in C/C++ . Pressure is on, to design and develop using standard C++ but also with energy consumption as an primary requirement. 

[This one is not a "simple" requirement](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01496266/document). [Somewhat paradoxically](https://youtu.be/koTf7u0v41o) this category of requirements requires less and less code and more and more performance in the same time. Smaller executables means less energy spent on that executable running and less energy for cooling the CPU running it.

## 10. Appendix C: valstat BNF definition

```
; occupancy states
empty     ::= true | false
has_value ::= true | false
occupancy_state ::== empty | has_value

; field is made of
; occupancy state and value
field ::=  occupancy_state AND value

; 'value' and 'status' are fields
value  ::= field
status ::= field

; valstat is AND combination of 
; two fields occupancy states
; combination of occupancy_states of two fields
valstat ::= is_empty(value) AND is_empty(status)

; valstat is a record made of two fields
valsat ::= value AND status
