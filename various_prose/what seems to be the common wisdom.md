### What seems to be the common wisdom

After decades of trying to deliver a common solution the consensus seems to be

- error or no error is irrelevant question[[1]](#ref1)
   - Returns consuming logic is not always binary: 
   - There are states in between the two
      - Non expected return might not be an error at all
   - There are signs the collective is moving in that direction.
- Complexity is avoided if binary "error or no error" logic is avoided
   - There are errors when fast exit is not a bad idea
- Consuming logic is not trivial "error or no error"
   - It is beneficial to agree to and follow the common return consuming logic
   - Presence of divergent return types, very quickly raises the level of complexity.
