### Inevitably, entropy is on the rise

Multiplication of homegrown function return solutions are gradually complicating the C++ landscape at large. Multiplying the costs, thus lowering the feasibility of C++ usage. After decades of home grown error handling and accompanying home grown return types, inevitably entropy rises. Both externally from users point of view, and internally from developers point of view. And there are high profile projects in and out of std lib, meeting these and some more issues head on.
