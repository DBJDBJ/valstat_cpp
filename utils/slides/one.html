# How to use

Open this file  and change `sourceUrl` to the required md file. Line to edit is easy to find. 

```html
<body onload="var slideshow = remark.create( /*{sourceUrl: 'my_slideset.md'}*/ );">
```
If your presentation is called 'slideset_one.md', and is in the same folder as this file is, your change will look like this:
```html
<body onload="var slideshow = remark.create({sourceUrl: 'slideset_one.md'} );">
```
Comments are removed and your file name is in. For best results place your presentations in the same folder as this file.

In that md you need to follow [REMARK md rules](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki) to turn it into slide show.

This file (`complete.html`) is portable; you don't need any other file, or an internet connection for your presentations.

???

Should we add instructions on using md files form different folders?
