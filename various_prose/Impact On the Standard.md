##  Impact On the Standard

- Inside std lib `std::valstat` would stay officially supported but not imposed. Just a recommended concept, not mandated in any way. Adopting valstat has no breaking legacy code risks attached to it. 

- Valstat adoption should lower the cost of C++ codebase maintenance. The interoperability barriers will be lower because everyone will follow the same concept and behavioral pattern.

- At least in this context, C++ community might find it easier to agree on the valstat as an simple "zero cost" mechanism that will make handling function returns, consistent and easy to handle. Both inside the teams and outside for the key stake holders and investors.
