### Guiding principles

P2000R1 is probably the closest there is to an set of guiding principles to the better and simpler standard C++. Author does hope, the valstat is seen as strongly in support of the following ( P2000R1 -- "[Direction for ISO C++](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/P2000R1.pdf)", Page 5): 

*"... we badly need to simplify use of
C++ and that leaves us with three alternatives:

- Provide simpler alternatives for simple uses
- Provide simplifying generalizations
- Provide alternatives to complicated and/or error-prone features.
  
Often, a significant improvement involves a combination of those three..."

Perhaps a bold claim, but adoption of `std::valstat` and `metastate` idea, should contributes, to all the three "requirements" above.
